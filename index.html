                </h3>
                <p>
                    The real home of Lake Geneva (no, not the one in Wisconsin), Geneva is
                    the southernmost city in Switzerland. It is framed by the Alps and Jura 
                    mountains, and is host to various major international organizations like
                    the UN and Red Cross. Earning its reputation as the "capital of peace",
                    this multicultural city combines old-town charm with a modern city vibe
                    seemlessly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the city where mornings begin with the glow of the sunlight 
                    reflecting off the soft water of the lake, and where nights are graced with 
                    the soft bustle of this compact city.

                            There's something uniquely comforting about Geneva that makes it feel 
                            both small and global at the same time. From its physical landmarks to its culture and traditions,
                            the city has accrued a variety of special traits.

                            From the Old Town, make your way to the <strong>Parc des Bastions</strong> either by foot or by taking a bus.
                            There, you can check out the <strong>Reformation Wall</strong> or sit on the grass to take a moment to soak it all in!

                            Carouge has countless hidden gems, go discover them and find a place to sit down for dinner & enjoy
                            the early evening vibes.

                    <strong>The primary spoken language is French, but don't fret!</strong>

                <p>
                    Since Geneva is such a culturally diverse city, everyone there speaks English too!

                <p>
                    One of the things that makes Geneva (and most other European cities) so special is 
                    how walkable it is, so get ready to get your walking game on!

                <p>
                    Geneva's public transport system, operated by TPG, is one of the best in the world.
                    Use it!

                <p>
                    The citizens are used to tourists, but that doesn't mean they appreciate unnecessarily
                    high volume...

                    Geneva is a wonderful place to visit, cherish your time there!
